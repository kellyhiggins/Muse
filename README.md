A Pirate's Radio
===========
Every journey has a story, and in the nooks and crannies of every place hides hidden inspiration. The streets and neighborhoods around us have inspired stories immortalized in song. A Pirate's Radio features music about the place where you are, and the places you're going. A voyager can log in with their Spotify account, and with the click of a button have a playlist generated for them based on their current location, or a journey by car, bike, or foot. If you want to build your own custom playlist, the Pirate's Radio Muse will build you a playlist around any subject appearing in the lyrics. 

The playlists are saved to your Spotify account, and your personal Pirate's Radio is ready to be taken on any adventure you dare!
